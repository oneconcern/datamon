## datamon bundle list

List bundles

### Synopsis

List the bundles in a repo, ordered by their bundle ID.

This is analogous to the "git log" command. The bundle ID works like a git commit hash.

```
datamon bundle list [flags]
```

### Examples

```
% datamon bundle list --repo ritesh-test-repo
Using config file: /Users/ritesh/.datamon/datamon.yaml
1INzQ5TV4vAAfU2PbRFgPfnzEwR , 2019-03-12 22:10:24.159704 -0700 PDT , Updating test bundle
```

### Options

```
      --batch-size int           Number of bundles streamed together as a batch. This can be tuned for performance based on network connectivity (default 1024)
      --concurrency-factor int   Heuristic on the amount of concurrency used by core operations. Concurrent retrieval of metadata is capped by the 'batch-size' parameter. Turn this value down to use less memory, increase for faster operations. (default 500)
  -h, --help                     help for list
      --repo string              The name of this repository
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --upgrade   Upgrades the current version then carries on with the specified command
```
