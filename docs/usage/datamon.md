## datamon

Datamon helps building ML pipelines

### Synopsis

Datamon helps building ML pipelines by adding versioning, auditing and security to cloud storage tools
(e.g. Google GCS, AWS S3).

This is not a replacement for these tools, but rather a way to manage their inputs and outputs.

Datamon works by providing a git like interface to manage data efficiently:
your data buckets are organized in repositories of versioned and tagged bundles of files.


### Options

```
      --config string   Set the config backend store to use (bucket name: do not set the scheme, e.g. 'gs://')
      --force           Forces upgrade even if the current version is not a released version
  -h, --help            help for datamon
      --upgrade         Upgrades the current version then carries on with the specified command
```
