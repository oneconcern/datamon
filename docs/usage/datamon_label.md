Commands to manage labels for a repo

### Synopsis

Commands to manage labels for a repo.

A label is a name given to a bundle, analogous to a tag in git.

Labels are a mapping type from human-readable strings to commit hashes.

There's one such map per repo, so in particular, setting a label or uploading a bundle
with a label that already exists overwrites the commit hash previously associated with the
label:  There can be at most one commit hash associated with a label.  Conversely,
multiple labels can refer to the same bundle via its commit hash (bundle ID).

### Examples

```
Latest
production
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for label
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string     Set the config backend store to use (bucket name: do not set the scheme, e.g. 'gs://')
      --context string    Set the context for datamon (default "dev")
      --loglevel string   The logging level. Levels by increasing order of verbosity: none, error, warn, info, debug (default "info")
      --upgrade           Upgrades the current version then carries on with the specified command
```
